## Introduction

* This analysis is performed through PA1_template.Rmd, which is compiled to PA1.md which, in turn, generates an HTML output: PA1_completed.html. 
* These files are located in the root directory of this GitHub repository.
* Figures are located in the "PA1_files/figure-markdown_github" sub-directory.
